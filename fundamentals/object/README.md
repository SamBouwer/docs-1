# Object

People, Books, Musicians, Documents, Ideas, Places, Numbers, or Files. In Anytype, these are all "objects". For instance, a person named "Enda," an essay to write, the music by "Pink Floyd," the film "2001", a town called "Berlin," a year, or just a simple status like "Done". **Everything** inside Anytype is an Object, including the other fundamental concepts [relation.md](../relation.md "mention"), [type](../type/ "mention"), and [set.md](../set.md "mention"). All are types of Objects. The _contents_ of objects are Blocks, which you can read more about below.

### How to create objects?

### Object Canvas

Every object has a flexible editing area that we call the "canvas". The canvas contains "blocks", each of which is a piece of information that you can freely move around the canvas. Blocks can take many forms and enable various functionality and design adjustments, including text colour and highlighting alignment, and more. You can add a new block to hold any information you like by hitting the `+` button or do so in-line by typing `/`. Hover over a block to see its size or move it elsewhere on the canvas. To create a column, drag one block alongside another block.

### **Object Layout**

Layouts help you customize how your object looks. For example, you can align your text blocks, change the icon type, or set the page full-width.

**Anytype currently supports three kinds of layout:**

1. **Basic:** a classic view for notes, articles, and docs.
2. **Profile:** designed for contacts, people, and organizations.
3. **Action:** for getting things done. Perfect for tasks and plans.

We have designed layouts to be extendable. In the future, users will be able to make custom layouts too!

{% hint style="info" %}
The width of the layout of your canvas can be adjusted for each Object individually. Use "Layout" > "Set layout width" and adjust the slider.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Primary and Profile layouts support either an emoji or a photo icon. All layouts, except Note, support a cover image.
{% endhint %}
